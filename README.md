# Schedule-Mania

## About
This project was to add code to an existing file to make the scheduler more interactive. You can type an event schedule for that time and save it so that it appears even after refreshing the page. 

## What I did
I added HTML code to create more times for a 9 am-5 pm work day and added JS to make the schedule more interactive. The JS is what saves the user input to Local Storage for later viewing. 

## Difficulties 
I had a hard time getting the input to save to local storage and having it saved on the webpage. You will find that the input saves in local storage as an object but does not appear on the webpage. I also had a hard time using and implementing JQuery.
